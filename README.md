# 🛡️ RuleSetRAT: Variant-Specific YARA Rules & Malware Builder Analysis

This repository provides a curated set of variant-specific YARA detection rules and detailed static analysis reports for various Remote Access Trojan (RAT) families and builder samples. The goal is to support professionals in the cybersecurity field with actionable intelligence, reverse engineering insights, and precision detection capabilities.

> ⚠️ This project is strictly intended for educational, academic, and ethical cybersecurity research purposes.

## 📦 Repository Structure

Each malware family or builder variant is organized into its own dedicated folder, containing:

- `Builder.yara` – Custom YARA rule tailored to the variant’s unique byte patterns and PE characteristics
- `CAPA/` – Generated static analysis output from FireEye’s CAPA tool (JSON format)
- `DIE/` – PE metadata and obfuscation insights from Detect It Easy (DIE) (JSON format)

All detection rules are manually reviewed and tested to ensure variant-level granularity, enabling high-confidence threat identification.

---

## 🧪 Methodology & Goals

This project is the product of extensive malware reverse engineering work. Each sample has been statically analyzed using multiple tools and methodologies, with the goal of:

- Crafting fine-tuned YARA rules capable of identifying specific variants or builder generations
- Documenting functional capabilities via CAPA
- Extracting PE structure and obfuscation metadata via DIE

By combining rule-based detection with structured static analysis data, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge base for malware researchers and defenders.

## 🔁 Commit Structure & Workflow

We deliberately maintained a granular commit history. Each change, rule addition, or metadata update was committed separately to preserve traceability and make the repository auditable.

> This disciplined commit structure enhances transparency, facilitates peer review, and ensures that future updates can be efficiently tracked and validated.
